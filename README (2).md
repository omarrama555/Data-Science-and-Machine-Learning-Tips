## 📚 Example Tips Format

You can add tips in this format inside a folder like `/tips/` or even use GitHub Discussions or Markdown files:

### Tip #1: Don’t trust accuracy blindly ⚠️

> **Problem:** Accuracy might be high even if the model is bad — especially with imbalanced datasets.
>
> **Solution:** Use other metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.
>
> **Example:**
> In a dataset where 95% of the labels are "No", a model that always predicts "No" will have 95% accuracy — but it's useless!
